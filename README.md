7. **03-Keras-Project-Exercise.ipynb**:
   - A Keras exercise notebook, possibly a guided project or tutorial on building and training Keras models.

### Datasets

- **lending_club_loan_two.csv**: Dataset for a classification project related to loan data, likely used to predict loan outcomes or risk factors.
- **CA_housing.csv**: Dataset containing California housing data, used in the `CA_housing.ipynb` regression notebook.
- **cancer_classification.csv**: A dataset for a classification task, likely predicting cancer types or presence based on given features.
- **fake_reg.csv**: A synthetic regression dataset used for model experimentation and training.
- **lending_club_info.csv**: Additional information or metadata for the lending club loan dataset.
- **kc_house_data.csv**: A dataset likely related to house pricing in the Seattle area, containing features for house attributes and pricing.

### Pre-trained Models

- **full_data_project_model.h5**: A pre-trained model file for one of the projects. Can be loaded and used for inference or further fine-tuning.
- **my_model.h5**: Another pre-trained model, specific to a project within this repository.
